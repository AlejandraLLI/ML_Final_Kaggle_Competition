# ML_Final_Kaggle_Competition

This repository has the code and solutions submitted to the Kaggle Competition **"Motion sensing in a Home"** for the final exam of the Machine Learning Course. 

The objective is to predict motion events in three home areas: kitchen, study and living room in a 10 second window based on past motion events across several home areas, power consumption and date as well as time. 

This task was accomplished estimating GBM models for the three home areas in conjunction and independently. 

Note that all coding and comments are in Spanish. There is no html or pdf output for the project, only the csv files submitted to the competition.
